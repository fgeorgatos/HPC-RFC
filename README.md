This is an effort to document some minimal common standards to follow across HPC sites;
external feedback is invited and much welcome, though at this point no formal method
has been defined about how to define such standards.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" 
in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119:
